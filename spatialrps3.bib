abstract = {Local Speeding
Early responses of species to climate change seemed to predict a general poleward response (or upward in mountains and downward in the ocean). Pinsky et al. (p. 1239) test an alternative hypothesis that relates more to the nature of climate change than to changes in temperature. Using nearly 50 years of coastal survey data on {\textgreater}350 marine taxa, they found that climate velocity was a much better predictor of patterns of change than individual species' characteristics or life histories. The findings suggest that responses to climate change largely track changes in local conditions.
Organisms are expected to adapt or move in response to climate change, but observed distribution shifts span a wide range of directions and rates. Explanations often emphasize biological distinctions among species, but general mechanisms have been elusive. We tested an alternative hypothesis: that differences in climate velocity—the rate and direction that climate shifts across the landscape—can explain observed species shifts. We compiled a database of coastal surveys around North America from 1968 to 2011, sampling 128 million individuals across 360 marine taxa. Climate velocity explained the magnitude and direction of shifts in latitude and depth much more effectively than did species characteristics. Our results demonstrate that marine species shift at different rates and directions because they closely track the complex mosaic of local climate velocities.
Variation in species' responses to climate change can be explained by differences in the local rates of climate change.

abstract = {A multispecies spatial model is proposed for evaluation of trawl management strategies and tested with data from British Columbia groundfish. Minimum stock sizes are estimated for 16 species using spatial catch per unit effort data; these data indicate that only small proportions of most stocks are exposed to fishing at any time and that exchange rates of fish between the grounds and other habitats are rapid. A gravity model for spatial effort allocation predicts substantial side effects of marine protected areas or discarding of particular species on nontarget species/grounds due to redistribution of fishing effort. Multispecies, multiground delay-difference models are used in conjunction with the gravity model for spatial effort distribution to predict long-term population responses to various regulatory strategies. This simulation suggests that species composition and spatial structure of the fishery are changing slowly due to reduction in abundance of long-lived species, but rapid collapses of target stocks are unlikely due to spatial redistribution of effort in response to local declines. We question whether quota management (individual vessel quotas) can be safely implemented due to extreme uncertainty about current stock sizes and suggest that a better strategy may be to simply denominate fishing rights as individual effort quotas while providing protection for sensitive stocks through carefully placed marine protected areas.},

@article{Haltuch2008,
abstract = {Fishery management plans for U.S. fisheries are required to specify status determination criteria (e.g. whether the stock is overfished and whether overfishing is occurring) and typically use harvest control rules to adjust target and limit fishing mortality and catch levels to prevent overfishing, achieve optimum yield and rebuild overfished stocks. The status determination criteria are based on the concept of the fishing mortality rate (FMSY) that maximizes long-term catch as the upper limit on the allowable rate of fishing and the associated BMSY, the spawning biomass which produces MSY, is the target for rebuilding of overfished stocks. In practice, proxies for the biological reference points FMSY and BMSY are often employed. Although several methods exist for estimating these quantities, it is unclear which performs best. Simulation is therefore used to evaluate alternative estimators for these quantities. These estimators differ in terms of whether a stock-recruitment relationship is estimated, and whether a prior based on Bayesian meta-analysis is used as a penalty on steepness, a critical parameter of the stock-recruitment relationship. The simulations consider three life histories: a long-lived unproductive rockfish, a moderately long-lived and productive flatfish, and a hake, which is also moderately long-lived and productive, but exhibits highly variable recruitment. Results indicate that estimator performance varies among reference points. However, estimators of B0, the average spawning biomass in the absence of exploitation, and stock depletion based on a fitted stock-recruitment relationship generally perform best. B0 is estimated either better (the rockfish and flatfish) or similarly (the hake) to stock depletion. Estimating BMSY from the fit of the stock-recruitment relationship performed best for the rockfish and flatfish life histories; average recruitment estimators proved to be best for the flatfish and hake life histories. Proxy methods of calculating BMSY generally performed relatively poor in comparison to the non-proxy measures. The performance of estimators of biological reference points was generally better for the rockfish and flatfish life histories, which were similar, than for the hake life history. Estimator performance was generally poorer in the presence of high recruitment variability. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Scientiﬁcally designed data collection ensures that estimates of relative abundance are unbiased. However, the statistical efﬁciency of a design-based estimator may be low under certain circumstances. We apply a recently developed spatiotemporal model that incorporates habitat variables to estimate a model-based abundance index for northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis) in the Gulf of Maine. We contrast this spatiotemporal index with a classical design-based index and evaluate the impacts of differences between the two abundance indices on the stock assessment. We show that using the spatiotemporal index in the assessment model greatly alters the estimates of recruitment and spawning stock biomass and the determination of stock status. Also, incorporating the spatiotemporal index leads to less retrospective bias and outperforms the model with design-based index in terms of predictive performance through a retrospective cross-validation test. Our results suggest that temporal variability of population abundance could be exaggerated by the design-based estimator, and such imprecision may greatly affect the performance of a stock assessment and subsequent development of management decisions.},

@article{benson_evaluating_2015,
abstract = {Despite broad recognition of the potential for significant spatial complexity in morphological, behavioral, and life-history traits within many fish populations, fisheries are commonly managed across large spatial scales that aggregate interacting sub-populations into single management units. Such mis-match between the ecological and management scales may lead to a loss of spatial diversity and a restricted ability of populations to adapt and persist in the presence of changing environmental conditions. Developing harvest strategies for spatially complex fish populations therefore remains a major challenge. In this study, we evaluate whether managing spatially complex fish stocks as large-scale aggregates leads to greater conservation risks. We develop a closed-loop simulation model that represents a range of dispersal scenarios and includes imperfect management knowledge about the abundances and dynamics of interacting Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) sub-populations, as well as weak management control of how exploitation is allocated among sub-populations. The latter is driven by the spatial dynamics of the fishing fleet as it seeks to optimize profitability. Simulated management outcomes did not always lead to increased risks under all scenarios of dispersal, fishery spatial dynamics, and management errors. Instead, these processes interacted to either mediate or intensify the impact of inappropriate management assumptions and stock assessment errors. Management strategies aimed directly at limiting exploitation risk consistently protected spatially complex populations in the presence of incorrect management assumptions about stock structure, high fishing power, and persistent stock assessment errors. Given the pervasiveness of these errors in fisheries, we recommend further evaluation of spatio-temporal refugia for tactical management of spatially complex fish populations.},

@article{Waterhouse2014,
abstract = {Most population models and stock assessment approaches assume that fish and fishing are spatially uniform. Here, we examine the effects of spatial structure on fishery selection (selectivity). Selectivity refers to the fact that age- or size-classes of fish are not equally vulnerable to fishing; such differences in class-specific vulnerabilities will influence the age-structure of a fish stock, which in turn will determine the stock's productivity and ability to sustain harvest. The selectivity of the gear produces a characteristic selection curve that is generally assumed to be asymptotic. However, population-level selection curves can deviate considerably from an asymptotic shape given spatial structure in the population. For example, given time-invariant recruitment and time-invariant age-specific survival, the shape of the selection curve at the level of the population will be dome-shaped under a wide range of conditions, even though the gear-selection curves operating in common in all areas within the population are asymptotic. This paper explores the factors, under equilibrium conditions, influencing the areas-as-fleets selection curves that result from using selectivity coefficients to represent spatial catch-at-age in a non-spatial population dynamics model. We use a simplified set of survival equations from Sampson and Scott (Can. J. Fish. Aquat. Sci. 68 (2011) 1077-1086), in which there are three distinct spatial regions with the same asymptotic selection curve operating in each region, and show that while the overall population-selectivity is typically dome shaped, the corresponding areas-as-fleets selection curve shapes differ from each other and from the population-selection and gear-selection curves. Factors that influence how much the selectivity curves differ from each other include the magnitude of the differences in the regional fishing mortality rates, the rates of fish movement and whether the movements are diffusive or directional, and the regional distribution of the recruits. If fish movement rates are relatively slow (say, less than 20{\%} per time-step), then in nearly all cases areas-as-fleets selectivity will differ from the underlying gear-selectivity, except under the extraordinary conditions of equal recruitment and equal fishing mortality across all spatial regions. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Different age classes do not generally experience the same rates of fishing mortality. The processes resulting in age- (or length-) selection operate at several scales. At the broadest scale, population-selection measures the age-specific probability of capture, while at the finest scale contact-selection describes the vulnerability of fish that encounter the fishing gear. Population-selectivity is the process most relevant to fish population dynamics and stock assessment, but it has received far less attention than processes operating at gear-specific scales. Despite wide recognition of the diverse shapes possible for population-selectivity, the processes determining these shapes are poorly understood. This paper develops a reasonably simple model of population-selectivity from a set of survival equations, coupled to allow movement between subpopulations, and explores the conditions necessary to produce different shaped population-selection curves. Important factors influencing the population-selectivity model are the gear-specific selection characteristics of the fleets, their effort levels relative to one another, the spatial distribution of fishing mortality, and the movement of fish between subpopulations. The model can generate quite complicated curves and has surprising properties. For example, under a wide variety of conditions, even though the same asymptotic gear-selectivity applies in all subpopulations, the overall population-selectivity will be dome-shaped unless fishing mortality is uniform across all subpopulations.},

However, estimating recruitment in a stock assessment model involves the challenging task of identifying a self-sustaining population, which often includes representing complex geographic structure. A review of several case studies demonstrated that alternative stock assessment models can influence estimates of recruitment. Incorporating spatial population structure and connectivity into stock assessment models changed the perception of recruitment events for a wide diversity of fisheries, but the degree to which estimates were impacted depended on movement rates and relative stock sizes. For multiple population components, estimates of strong recruitment events and the productivity of smaller population units were often more sensitive to connectivity assumptions. Simulation testing, conditioned on these case studies, suggested that accurately accounting for population structure, either in management unit definitions or stock assessment model structure, improved recruitment estimates. An understanding of movement dynamics improved estimation of connected sub-populations. The challenge of representing geographic structure in stock assessment emphasizes the importance of defining self-sustaining management units to justify a unit-stock assumption.},

Simulated reference points were compared across a range of population structures and connectivity scenarios demonstrating the inﬂuence of spatial assumptions on management benchmarks. Simulations also illustrated that applying a harvest level based on misdiagnosed spatial structure leads to biased stock status indicators, overharvesting, or foregone yield. Across the scenarios examined, incorrectly specifying the connectivity dynamics (particularly misdiagnosing source–sink dynamics) was often more detrimental than ignoring spatial structure altogether. However, when the true dynamics exhibited spatial structure, incorrectly assuming panmictic structure resulted in severe depletion if harvesting concentrated on more productive population units (instead of being homogeneously distributed). Incorporating spatially generalized operating models, such as the one developed here, into management strategy evaluations will help develop management procedures that are more robust to spatial complexities.},

abstract = {Abstract
According to density-dependent habitat selection theory, areas of high density can be indicative of high population productivity and have positive individual fitness consequences. Here, we explore six groundfish populations on the Scotian Shelf, Canada, where a decline in areas of high density beyond a certain threshold is associated with disproportionately large declines in Spawning Stock Biomass (SSB). This is evidenced by empirical, concave, positive relationships between high-density areas (HDAs) and SSB. We introduce a methodology to estimate the threshold below which SSB declines increasingly faster per unit of HDA decline. The spatial threshold among these six stocks was remarkably consistent; when stocks lose 70–80{\%} of HDAs, disproportionately large SSB declines are likely to occur. We propose that spatial thresholds could serve as spatial reference points to complement existing SSB limit reference points (LRPs). For some stocks we identify spatial thresholds which correspond to SSB levels that exceed those associated with the designated SSB LRP, suggesting that a review of these SSB LRPs warrants merit. For other stocks, spatial reference points can be used in concert with SSB reference points, strengthening efforts to incorporate a precautionary approach to fisheries management. Our results warrant further research into the general application of HDA as spatial limit and target reference points for fisheries management in addition to other population status indicators within a broad recovery framework.},

abstract = {Implementation of an ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAFM) for forage fish requires methods to evaluate tradeoffs associated with competing management objectives that focus on supporting fishery yields or providing food for predators. We developed an Ecopath with Ecosim ecosystem model of the U.S. Northwest Atlantic continental shelf (NWACS) for the period 1982–2013 to inform an EAFM for Atlantic Menhaden Brevoortia tyrannus. The model (with 61 trophic groups and 8 fishing fleets) was parameterized and fitted to time series using data from stock assessments, surveys, and literature. Fifty-year simulations evaluated how Atlantic Menhaden fishing mortality rates (F) influenced different ecosystem indicators, including population biomasses, fishery yields, prey-to-predator ratios, and the proportion of trophic groups that were positively or negatively affected. We quantified tradeoffs associated with a range of alternative ecosystem-based reference points for Atlantic Menhaden F and biomass (B), including F for maximum sustainable yield (FMSY), 0.5FMSY, proxies for current single-species F reference points, 75{\%} of virgin unfished biomass (B0), and 40{\%}B0. Striped Bass Morone saxatilis were most sensitive to increases in Atlantic Menhaden fishing, largely due to their strong dietary reliance on this prey species, but other higher-trophic-level groups (birds, highly migratory species, sharks, and marine mammals) were also negatively impacted. Other commercially important predators of Atlantic Menhaden (e.g., Bluefish Pomatomus saltatrix and Weakfish Cynoscion regalis) had moderate to negligible responses at the highest levels of Atlantic Menhaden F. The alternative reference points considered resulted in (1) variable Atlantic Menhaden biomasses (40–75{\%} of B0) and yields (54–100{\%} of MSY), (2) up to a 60{\%} decline in Striped Bass B and yield, (3) negative impacts on the B of ≤13{\%} of modeled groups, and (4) positive impacts on the B of ≤6{\%} of modeled groups. Simulations demonstrated the varied responses, potential winners and losers, and tradeoffs resulting from alternative management strategies for Atlantic Menhaden. These results and the NWACS model can help to advance an EAFM for Atlantic Menhaden and other fishes.Received April 4, 2017; accepted July 19, 2017},

abstract = {Understanding population dynamics is essential for achieving sustainable and productive fisheries. However, estimating recruitment in a stock assessment model involves the challenging task of identifying a self-sustaining population, which often includes representing complex geographic structure. A review of several case studies demonstrated that alternative stock assessment models can influence estimates of recruitment. Incorporating spatial population structure and connectivity into stock assessment models changed the perception of recruitment events for a wide diversity of fisheries, but the degree to which estimates were impacted depended on movement rates and relative stock sizes. For multiple population components, estimates of strong recruitment events and the productivity of smaller population units were often more sensitive to connectivity assumptions. Simulation testing, conditioned on these case studies, suggested that accurately accounting for population structure, either in management unit definitions or stock assessment model structure, improved recruitment estimates. An understanding of movement dynamics improved estimation of connected sub-populations. The challenge of representing geographic structure in stock assessment emphasizes the importance of defining self-sustaining management units to justify a unit-stock assumption.},

abstract = {Many, if not most, stocks of fish and invertebrates subject to commercial, recreational or subsistence harvesting exhibit some degree of spatial heterogeneity. This can be due to a lack of complete movement within a single biological population or due to the assessed region consisting of multiple sub-stocks. In principle, assessments for stocks for which the assumption of homogeneity is violated should be based on population dynamics models that are spatially-explicit. There are, however, relatively few stocks for which multi-stock/multi-area assessments are conducted. However, the number of assessments in which space is explicitly represented in the population dynamics model has been increasing in recent years and such models are available for fish stocks such as New Zealand hoki and canary rockfish off the US west coast, as well as invertebrates such as the rock lobsters off southern Australia and New Zealand. A challenge within such spatially-explicit assessments pertains to how recruitment and movement are modelled. This paper reviews assessments for fish and invertebrate stocks that are based on spatially-explicit models, identifying the challenges associated with modelling recruitment caused by increased model and parameter estimation complexity, and the available solutions. A set of illustrative simulations are undertaken to evaluate the consequences of different assumptions regarding spatial recruitment and movement, and hence develop some recommendations for best practice guidelines.},

abstract = {Draft guidelines for National Standards under the Magnuson-Stevens Act state that Councils should adopt a precautionary approach to specification of Optimum Yield (OY), and list three features which characterize this approach: 1.) target reference points such as OY should be set safely below limit reference points (such as the Maximum Sustainable Yield, MSY); 2.) stocks at sizes below the level that produces MSY should be harvested at lower rates than stocks at sizes above the level that produces MSY; 3.) as uncertainty about stock status or productive capacity increases, target catch levels should be more cautious. The guidelines indicate limit reference points which include a maximum fishing mortality rate which produces MSY and minimum stock size thresholds from which a stock could be rebuilt to MSY within ten years. Reference points can be direct estimates or proxies for direct estimates, depending on adequacy of available data. In this paper, we review desirable properties of directly-estimated and potential proxy biological reference points, in the contexts of the National Standards, guidelines, approaches adopted by international management bodies, and other more generic contexts of the precautionary approach. We compare alternative candidate reference points in terms of their utility and potential performance as limit or target reference points in risk-averse management frameworks.},

The framework is highly scalable from data-weak situations where it operates as an age-structured production model, to complex situations where it can flexibly incorporate multiple data sources and account for biological and environmental processes. SS implements compensatory population dynamics through use of a function relating mean recruitment to spawner reproductive output. This function enhances the ability of SS to operate in data-weak situations and enables it to estimate fishery management quantities such as fishing rates that would provide for maximum sustainable yield and to employ these rates in forecasts of potential yield and future stock status. Complex model configurations such as multiple areas and multiple growth morphs are possible, tag-recapture data can be used to aid estimation of movement rates among areas, and most parameters can change over time in response to environmental and ecosystem factors. SS is coded using Auto-Differentiation Model Builder, so inherits its powerful capability to efficiently estimate hundreds of parameters using either maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference. Output processing, principally through a package developed in R, enables rapid model diagnosis. Details of the underlying population dynamics and the statistical framework used within SS are provided. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

The computations are designed to be fast for problems with many random effects (≈ 106) and parameters (≈ 103). Computation times using ADMB and TMB are compared on a suite of examples ranging from simple models to large spatial models where the random effects are a Gaussian random field. Speedups ranging from 1.5 to about 100 are obtained with increasing gains for large problems. The package and examples are available at http://tmb-project.org/.},

Based on the information about small yellow croaker (Larimichthys polyactis) off the coast of China, we simulated a fish population consisting of three subpopulations mixing at intermediate levels, which was considered in the "true" spatial structure of the population in this study. Three scenarios of population spatial structure were assumed in assessing and managing this simulated fishery: (i) metapopulation, which has the same structure as the "true" population; (ii) three independent subpopulations, which overlook the exchanges among the subpopulations; and (iii) unit population, which completely ignores the population spatial structure. Corresponding approaches were applied to assess and manage each of these assumed fish populations. The management time period was assumed to be 10 years with two harvesting levels (i.e., maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and f0.1). Assessing and managing the metapopulation as several independent populations could lead to a high probability of overexploitation. Managing the metapopulation as a unit population could lead to local depletion. Use of MSY as a management target may be risk prone in the existence of a metapopulation, and use of a fishing mortality lower than f0.1 as a management target is more desirable.},

We show that spatial patterns in ﬁshing mortality degrade model performance for sessile stocks. Fishing mortality tended to be overestimated and abundance underestimated because trends in ﬁshing mortality were exaggerated and the model misestimated the numbers of larger individuals due to spatial ﬁshing patterns. These results are particularly relevant to sedentary species such as scallops, but are applicable wherever strong spatial patterns exist in ﬁshing mortality.},

abstract = {Some fish stock assessments are conducted in regions that contain no-take marine reserves (NTMRs). NTMRs are expected to lead to spatial heterogeneity in fish biomass by allowing a buildup of biomass inside their borders while fishing pressure occurs outside. Stock assessments do not typically account for spatial heterogeneity caused by NTMRs, which may lead to biased estimates of biomass. Simulation modeling is used to analyze the ability of several stock assessment configurations to estimate current biomass after the implementation of a single, large NTMR. Age-structured spatial operating models with three patterns of ontogenetic movement are used to represent the “true” population dynamics. Results show that assessing populations as a single stock with use of fishery catch-rate data and without accounting for the NTMR results in severe underestimation of biomass for two of the movement patterns. Omitting fishery catch-rate data or allowing time-varying dome-shaped selectivity after NTMR implementation leads to improved estimates of current biomass, but severe bias in estimated trends in biomass over time. Performing separate assessments for fished areas and NTMRs leads to improved estimation performance in the absence of movement among assessment areas, but can severely overestimate biomass otherwise. Performing a spatial assessment with estimation of movement parameters among areas was found to be the best way to assess a species, even when movement patterns were unknown. However, future work should explore the performance of spatial assessments when catchability varies among areas.},

abstract = {Most population models and stock assessment approaches assume that ﬁsh and ﬁshing are spatially uniform. Here, we examine the effects of spatial structure on ﬁshery selection (selectivity). Selectivity refers to the fact that age- or size-classes of ﬁsh are not equally vulnerable to ﬁshing; such differences in class-speciﬁc vulnerabilities will inﬂuence the age-structure of a ﬁsh stock, which in turn will determine the stock's productivity and ability to sustain harvest. The selectivity of the gear produces a characteristic selection curve that is generally assumed to be asymptotic. However, population-level selection curves can deviate considerably from an asymptotic shape given spatial structure in the population. For example, given time-invariant recruitment and time-invariant age-speciﬁc survival, the shape of the selection curve at the level of the population will be dome-shaped under a wide range of conditions, even though the gear-selection curves operating in common in all areas within the population are asymptotic. This paper explores the factors, under equilibrium conditions, inﬂuencing the areas-as-ﬂeets selection curves that result from using selectivity coefﬁcients to represent spatial catch-at-age in a non-spatial population dynamics model. We use a simpliﬁed set of survival equations from Sampson and Scott (Can. J. Fish. Aquat. Sci. 68 (2011) 1077–1086), in which there are three distinct spatial regions with the same asymptotic selection curve operating in each region, and show that while the overall population-selectivity is typically dome shaped, the corresponding areas-as-ﬂeets selection curve shapes differ from each other and from the population-selection and gear-selection curves. Factors that inﬂuence how much the selectivity curves differ from each other include the magnitude of the differences in the regional ﬁshing mortality rates, the rates of ﬁsh movement and whether the movements are diffusive or directional, and the regional distribution of the recruits. If ﬁsh movement rates are relatively slow (say, less than 20{\%} per time-step), then in nearly all cases areas-as-ﬂeets selectivity will differ from the underlying gear-selectivity, except under the extraordinary conditions of equal recruitment and equal ﬁshing mortality across all spatial regions.},

abstract = {Natural and human stressors in the high seas act across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. These include direct interaction such as fisheries bycatch or indirect interaction like warming oceans and plastic ingestion. Area-based management tools (ABMTs), such as marine protected areas and time-area closures, are a widely accepted and a broadly successful form of management used to mitigate localized human impacts on marine species and ecosystems. Protection provides an opportunity for population recovery, which can then propagate outside of the closure. As the United Nations negotiates a new treaty on the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction, efforts to design and implement high seas ABMTs at appropriate scales are critical to ensure that these spatial protection measures are most effective and climate-ready in the face of changing oceans. Here we identify the four most important temporal scales – contemporary, intra-annual, multi-annual and multidecadal – for aligning high seas ABMTs to relevant ecological, oceanographic and atmospheric processes. From this, we explore how managers and decision-makers can integrate this knowledge when implementing a new treaty.},

abstract = {A method to estimate Fmsy and its proxies based on survey indices of stock size and recruitment was developed and tested on simulated data sets and on ﬁve real stocks in the Baltic and Celtic Sea. The considered stocks were stocks with full analytical assessments (to compare the Fmsy estimates of the method with available analytical estimates), two stocks with assessments considered indicative of trends only, and one fully data-limited stock. The method combined yield-per-recruit (YPR) and spawning stock-per-recruit (SPR) analysis with survey-based stock-recruitment relationships. Various levels of uncertainty in the survey data and stock-recruitment relationships were considered in the tests. Tests on simulated data sets showed very low diﬀerences (no more than 0.01 for medians of estimates) between the generated Fmsy and F40{\%}SSB (F for which the stock is reduced to 40{\%} of the unﬁshed stock) and respective estimates from survey-based methods. For sprat and herring in the Baltic Sea, the Fmsy estimates using the proposed method and survey data were comparable to the Fmsy based on analytical stock assessments. The method provided closer estimates of Fmsy than Fmsy proxies such as F0.1, F40{\%}, and the Fmax from YPR and SPR analysis.},

abstract = {Casal2 (pronounced Casal-two) has replaced CASAL, New Zealand's integrated fish stock assessment package since 2002. Casal2 replicates most of CASAL's functions such as many stocks, fisheries, and areas; age- or length-based dynamics; the use of several data sources (e.g., abundance indices, age frequencies, and tagging), but it has been extended into a generalised modelling tool and it uses more efficient programming practices and tools than CASAL. CASAL has enabled a more efficient use of resources for stock assessments, such as allowing a wider range of staff to conduct assessments, helped communication between members of the Assessment Working Groups, enabling a focus on fits of the models and model structure since standardised methods meant that model components were known and rigorous testing ensured confidence that the code base was validated. Design decisions taken at an early stage in CASAL's development now limit its expansion. Re-coding CASAL was New Zealand's best option to retain the benefits of CASAL and to control its own destiny over progress in new stock assessment techniques, such as easy use in management strategy evaluations. We have replicated many CASAL assessments successfully and so will release the first version of Casal 2 in 2016 as an open source package under the GPL-2.0 licence.

abstract = {The inﬂuence of model complexity on integrated tagging and catch-at-age analysis (ITCAAN) parameter estimation is poorly understood for populations exhibiting natal homing. We investigated ITCAAN performance under varying levels of movement, degree of similarity in population productivities, data quality, spatial complexity in parameterization, and whether natural mortality and (or) reporting rates were ﬁxed at actual values, estimated, or misspeciﬁed. Dynamics of four populations with natal homing that intermixed during periods of harvest were simulated based on Lake Erie walleye (Sander vitreus). Our results suggest, when high-quality tagging data are available, ITCAAN models are able to simultaneously estimate movement rates, natural mortality, and tag reporting rates, though accuracy and precision of model estimates will decrease with greater model complexity and fewer tags released. Additionally, ITCAAN models may have difﬁculty estimating individual population abundances under certain movement rates when population productivities are vastly different. ITCAAN models that estimate natural mortality and reporting rates may perform best with similar sized populations and when data are available to assist the estimation of reporting rates.},

abstract = {Fishery management decisions are commonly guided by stock assessment models that aggregate outputs across the spatial domain of the species. With reﬁned understanding of spatial population structures, scientists have begun to address how spatiotemporal mismatches among the scale of ecological processes, data collection programs, and stock assessment methods (or assumptions) inﬂuence the reliability and, ultimately, appropriateness of regional ﬁshery management (e.g., assigning regional quotas). Development and evaluation of spatial modeling techniques to improve ﬁsheries assessment and management have increased rapidly in recent years. We overview the historical context of spatial models in ﬁsheries science, highlight recent advances in spatial modeling, and discuss how spatial models have been incorporated into the management process. Despite limited examples where spatial assessment models are used as the basis for management advice, continued investment in ﬁne-scale data collection and associated spatial analyses will improve integration of spatial dynamics and ecosystem-level interactions in stock assessment. In the near future, spatiotemporal ﬁsheries management advice will increasingly rely on ﬁne-scale outputs from spatial analyses.},

@article{Hurtado-Ferro2014,
abstract = {There is widespread recognition that spatial structure is important for fisheries stock assessment, and several efforts have been made to incorporate spatial structure into assessment models. However, most studies exploring the impact of ignoring spatial structure in stock assessments have developed population models with multiple subpopulations, rather than exploring the impact spatial dynamics may have on performance of non-spatially structured assessment methods. Furthermore, the data available for stock assessments usually do not include tagging or other data necessary to estimate movement rates. One solution to this problem is to include several fleets, each with a different selectivity pattern to represent availability, within a spatially-aggregated assessment method. In this study, the impacts of ignoring spatial structure, and the effectiveness of using multiple selectivity patterns as a proxy for spatial structure, are evaluated for the northern subpopulation of Pacific sardine (or California sardine; Sardinops sagax). A spatially-explicit operating model is used to explore three spatial factors: the existence of size-dependent seasonal migrations across large geographical areas, the influx of another stock into the area of the assessed stock, and the occurrence of recruitment outside the area where it is assumed to occur. Two other factors related to data were evaluated: data availability and data collection design. The assessment model (AM) is based on the 2010 stock assessment for Pacific sardine, implemented in Stock Synthesis, and includes two seasons per year and six fleets, each with a different selectivity pattern. Ignoring spatial structure is found to negatively impact estimation performance, with seasonal movement having the largest impact. The AM compensates for ignoring movement and spatial structure by adjusting the selectivity patterns, but selectivity alone is not able to account for all biases caused by spatial structure. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Stocks with limited movement of postsettlement ﬁsh may be spatially structured due to environmental forces that affect larval dispersal and recruitment distribution or from nonuniform spatial exploitation. Data are frequently aggregated across space in stock assessments, thus disregarding this complex spatial structure and possibly introducing bias into estimates of stock status. An operating model (OM) is created that simulates data that are used in a set of estimation models to assess bias. The following experimental factors are considered: (i) using survey data and environmental indices in the assessment; (ii) using disaggregated data (two regions, as generated by the OM) or aggregated data (one region); and (iii) incorporating different patterns in the OM's regional exploitation and environmentally driven recruitment distribution.},

In some places, closed areas have been used for fisheries management for centuries [1] and, until recently, natural refugia also existed, inaccessible through depth, distance or adverse conditions. Developments in technology have left few areas of fishing interest beyond our reach. Recently, the idea of marine reserves as fisheries management tools has re-emerged with developing interest in ecosystem-based management, and observations of incidental fisheries benefits from reserves established for conservation. In light of new evidence, we argue that, by integrating large-scale networks of marine reserves into fishery management, we could reverse global fishery declines and provide urgently needed protection for marine species and their habitats.},

abstract = {Population features inferred from single-species, age-structured models are compared to those inferred from a multispecies, age-structured model that includes predator-prey interactions among three commercially harvested fish species—walleye pollock, Atka mackerel, and Pacific cod—on the Aleutian Shelf, Alaska. The multispecies framework treats the single-species models and data as a special case of the multispecies model and data. The same data from fisheries and surveys are used to estimate model parameters for both single-species and multispecies configurations of the model. Additionally, data from stomach samples and predator rations are used to estimate the parameters of the multispecies model. One form of the feeding functional response, predator pre-emption, was selected using AIC from seven alternative models for how the predation rate changes with the densities of prey and possibly other predators. Differences in estimated population dynamics and productivity between the multispecies and single-species models were observed. The multispecies model estimated lower mackerel population sizes from 1964–2003 than the single-species model, while the spawning biomass of pollock was estimated to have declined more than three times faster since 1964 by the multispecies model. The variances around the estimates of spawning biomass were smaller for mackerel and larger for pollock in the multispecies model compared to the single-species model.},

The operating model underlying the projections is based on pink ling, Genypterus blacodes, off southern Australia and assumes that animals are sedentary following settlement. The management strategies are able to move the resource towards the target level in the absence of spatial closures even though assessment results are biased. The probability of reducing the stock below its limit reference point is higher when growth rates vary spatially, but the effect is small. The probability of the stock being above its target reference point is lower when one of the smaller spatial areas is closed. However, performance is markedly different when a larger fraction of the total area is closed, with stock size being substantially larger than the target at the end of the projection period.},

abstract = {Spatial stock assessments have been developed to address violations of the dynamic pool assumption that the region to be assessed contains a single homogeneous stock. The possibility of such violation is often evident in data that suggest different trends in abundance or catch / survey age- / size-structure among areas that cannot be explained simply by the fishing history among areas. Currently, most stock assessments account for spatial structure using the ‘areas-as-fleets' approach in which fishery or survey selectivity and catchability are assumed to differ spatially. However, several simulation studies suggest that adopting spatial approaches to stock assessment will improve estimation performance compared to the areas-as-fleets approach or ignoring spatial structure when conducting stock assessments, although at the cost of a larger number of estimable parameters. Spatial approaches to stock assessment and the provision of management advice have been available since the 1950s. However, spatial stock assessments only became adopted for management purposes in the 1990s, with the widespread adoption of the “integrated approach” to stock assessment, which allowed the use of multiple data sets for parameter estimation. The number of spatial stock assessments is now increasing rapidly. This paper outlines some of the key decisions that need to be made when conducting a spatial stock assessment (number of areas, how to model recruitment, movement, growth and dispersal, and model parameterization).},

abstract = {Most fisheries stock assessment methods are based on the assumption that fish are homogeneously distributed across the area being assessed or that fish movement is such that local fishing pressure does not lead to heterogeneous spatial patterns of abundance. However, this assumption is seldom valid in practice. Seven alternative approaches for conducting assessments when confronted with possible spatial variation in fishing mortality, growth and recruitment are identified. These approaches range from ignoring spatial structure, to conducting a multi-area assessment that accounts for spatial variation in biological and fishery processes. These seven approaches are tested using simulations in which there is a single population with spatial heterogeneity, and the only linkage among areas is larval movement. The simulations are based on fishery and biological characteristics for pink ling, Genypterus blacodes, off southeast Australia. Non-spatial assessment configurations that aggregate spatially-structured data provide more precise, but nevertheless biased estimates of initial and final spawning biomass, as well as biased estimates of the ratio between initial and final spawning biomass. Assessment configurations that allow for spatial structure can provide imprecise and highly biased estimates, although these can be improved by changing the relative weighting applied to different data types. A spatially-structured assessment configuration that correctly matches the structure of the model used to generate the simulated data sets is unbiased but imprecise. When confronted with possible spatial heterogeneity in biological and fishery parameters, we propose conducting sensitivity analyses based on several model configurations to select the appropriate structure for an assessment. The capacity to examine model residuals spatially remains valuable for inferring problems with model specification.},

In all cases, fishing fleets behave rationally within the imposed regulatory structures. Successful, generalist fishermen who take risks often pioneer developing fisheries. At this stage, regulations and subsidies tend to encourage excessive entry and investments, creating the potential for serial depletion. In mature fisheries, regulations often restrict season length, vessel and gear types, fishing areas, and fleet size, causing or exacerbating the race for fish and excessive investment, and are typically unsuccessful except when combined with dedicated access privileges (e.g., territorial rights, individual quotas). In senescent fisheries, vessel buyback programs must account for the fishing power of individuals and their vessels. Subsidies should be avoided as they prolong the transition towards alternative employment. Fisheries managers need to create individual incentives that align fleet dynamics and fishermen behavior with the intended societal goals. These incentives can be created both through management systems like dedicated access privileges and through market forces. {\textcopyright} 2006 NRC.},

abstract = {Environmental variability has a strong influence on marine fish stocks. Thus, management and harvest policies based on deterministic indicators, such as maximum sustainable yield (MSY), may be inappropriate facing such uncertainties. In this study, we investigate the long-term behavior of a single-species fishery, whose stock is harvested by several fleets and affected by variability in the recruitment. The dynamics of this population is modeled by a discrete-time stochastic age-structured model. In this context, we introduce the concepts of maximum expected, log expected, and harmonic expected sustainable yield, as biological reference points. We illustrate these concepts with a case study of the Patagonian toothfish fishery in Chile and Argentina. Via Monte-Carlo simulations, we verify that high levels of variability have a negative effect on all these maximum expected reference points, which suggests the need to be more cautious when large levels of variability on recruitment impact the fishery. Our simulations show that the deterministic MSY may not be attained in the presence of environmental noise, and therefore its use may lead to a failure of management strategies or rebuilding plans. Recommendations for Resource Managers For sustainable harvest, proper accounting of stochasticity in recruitment dynamics is necessary. For high levels of volatility, the use of deterministic reference points to develop regulations, such as maximum sustainable yield (MSY), may lead to overexploitation and even a possible extinction of the fishery. We extend the MSY to the stochastic age-structured framework by means of maximum expected stationary yield, maximum expected log-sustainable yield, and maximum expected harmonic sustainable yield, which can be used as precautionary reference points. These three maximum expected yields and their respective optimal fishing mortalities decrease when the variability of fish recruitment increases. This stresses the need to be more cautious in presence of volatility.},

abstract = {The Northern Zone rock lobster fishery in South Australia is extensive, covering ca. 207 000 km2. Managed under transferable quotas, the majority of the annual total allowable commercial catch (TACC) is taken on eastern inshore grounds, targeting the smaller redder lobsters favoured by Chinese buyers. The confined nature of fishing under the TACC system has led to concerns of localized spatial depletion and suggested a need for spatial management. A regional partition of the TACC was proposed. Formal prescriptive decision-rule tables for setting regional TACCs annually were constructed based on target exploitation rates. A target exploitation rate of 20{\%} historically produced zero average yearly change in biomass and, in previous bioeconomic projection modelling, achieved near-optimal net economic return. Using an age-based fishery assessment model that fits to catch totals by both weight and number landed, conditioning on fishing effort and mean weights-at-age, we estimated harvestable biomass for three regions. The management response was to establish inner and outer subzones where separate TACC decision rules are now adopted. Basing the harvest strategy on a target exploitation rate underlies a simple direct method for constructing decision-rule tables for setting TACC using the indicator of previous year's catch per unit effort (cpue). In the normal cpue range, a constant target exploitation rate is applied. At lower levels of stock abundance, below a designated upper limit reference point of cpue, the exploitation rates used to assign TACCs are set to decline linearly from the normal target level, reaching zero at a designated lower-limit reference cpue point below which the fishery is closed. At higher levels of cpue, stakeholders agreed to a TACC cap, under which exploitation rate decreases if biomass rises. This case study applies where formal harvest strategy decision rules for quota-based lobster fisheries are considered at finer spatial scales.},

This is common in the oceans, where spatial scales of management can be mismatched with spatially dynamic metapopulations. We explore causes, consequences and potential solutions for spatial mismatches in metapopulations of an important forage fish by combining empirical analysis, numerical modeling and novel theory. We show that spatial complexity can promote stability at large scales, however ignoring complexity produces cryptic and negative consequences at small scales. Harvesting metapopulations magnifies spatial variability, which creates discrepancies between regional and local trends while increasing risk of local population collapses. Such effects asymmetrically impact locally constrained fishers and predators, which are more exposed to risks of cryptic collapses. Importantly, we show that dynamically optimizing harvest can minimize local risk without sacrificing yield. Thus, multiple nested scales of management can help avoid cryptic collapses and the ensuing ecological, social and economic consequences.},

abstract = {Integrated analysis (or integrated population modelling) methods have become the preferred approach for conducting stock assessments, and providing the basis for management advice for ﬁsh and invertebrate stocks since the publication of a seminal paper by Fournier and Archibald in 1982. Methods to assess ﬁsh stocks based on single-species, single-area, age-structured models are now standard, with the major debates associated with these models related to data choice, model conﬁguration assumptions, and data weighting. However, the current generation of stock assessment packages is not addressing all of the needs of stock assessment analysts and managers. A major challenge for any next-generation stock assessment package is the set of extensions needed to assess stocks that do not satisfy the ‘well-mixed single-stock' paradigm. In addition, the next-generation stock assessment package needs to: (a) be able to capture age and size/stage dynamics simultaneously yet computationally eﬃciently, (b) scale from data-rich to data-poor, (c) include some multi-species capability, and (d) more appropriately deal with temporal variation (e.g., random eﬀects and state-space models). In relation to data, there is a need to ensure that the next-generation stock assessment package better handles tagging data (agesize/stage models may help in this regard), in particular, to be able to use close-kin mark-recapture data. Eﬃcient methods are needed to share parameter priors among stocks (satisfying the promise of the ‘Robin Hood' paradigm). The next-generation stock assessment package needs to have associated appropriate training programs and documentation. Adoption of such a package will be facilitated by a data entry system that is welldocumented, does not require speciﬁcation of inputs that will not be used in an application, has an expert system to conﬁgure default settings based on best practices, and has associated code to automatically produce diagnostic statistics. Some technical challenges that have plagued stock assessment for decades warrant continued attention (at the theoretical and applied level) such as automatic data weighting and tuning, how to handle spatial and stock structure, improved coding to facilitate application of state-of-the-art methods for quantifying uncertainty, and adoption of true state-space formulations to allow more parameters to be treated as random eﬀects. Future needs for features cannot be anticipated, so the key design consideration for the next-generation stock assessment package is to be ﬂexible and modiﬁable to meet the requirements of analysts and users.},

Despite the diversity in tuna populations and tRFMO scientiﬁc processes, there are many common recruitment themes, including: (i) ﬁsheries-independent recruitment monitoring is diﬃcult and rare (the aerial surveys for juvenile southern blueﬁn tuna, Thunnus maccoyi, and juvenile eastern Atlantic blueﬁn tuna stocks, T. thynnus, are the only time series used in assessments), (ii) most statistical models estimate lognormal recruitment deviations around a stationary Beverton-Holt relationship using a penalized likelihood approach, (iii) the degree of compensation in the stock-recruitment relationship and the variance is diﬃcult to estimate (steepness is usually ﬁxed at 0.7 ≤ h ≤ 1.0, and the CV is most often ﬁxed with $\sigma$R = 0.6 for lognormal recruitment deviations), and (iv) estimated recruitment time series often deviate systematically from the mean relationship, but it is unclear the extent to which this reﬂects reality (e.g. environmental change) or estimation artefacts (e.g. incorrect model assumptions or biased data). There is a trend toward the use of model ensembles to represent recruitment (and other sources of) uncertainty, both in the context of traditional assessments and management strategy evaluation. Recommendations include: i) continued development of ﬁsheries-independent recruitment monitoring methods, including adopting emerging technologies (e.g. genetics-based mark-recapture or abundance monitoring with a network of acoustic FADs), and (ii) the management paradigm should be designed to be robust to future recruitment uncertainties (e.g. recognize that recruitment compensation might be much lower than model-based estimates or assumptions, and be prepared to respond to substantial serially-correlated recruitment deviations, e.g. regime shifts). Following a history of over-exploitation and diﬃculties in reaching international scientiﬁc and management consensus, the CCSBT now provides a leading example of how tuna recruitment issues might be addressed through innovative monitoring, comprehensive modelling of uncertainty, and management with simulation-tested management procedures.},

abstract = {Harvest control rules (HCRs), key components of fisheries management strategies, are used to calculate recommended catch levels given estimates of present stock biomass or levels of fishing mortality. Spatial variability, either in the population dynamics, fishery operations, or in data collection, has the potential to impact HCR performance as this can drive variability in indicators used for stock assessment. A management strategy evaluation (MSE) approach was used to evaluate the performance of HCRs for blue eye trevalla (Hyperoglyphe antarctica), a species that exhibits spatial variability in monitoring data in southeast Australia. Employing catch curve analysis, the HCRs rely solely on information from the age structure of the catch. Several versions of the HCRs were tested, varying the reference points used to determine management actions, and the way spatial variability was accounted for when setting catch limits. The results suggest that effective implementation of the HCRs is challenging, requiring appropriate choice of reference points and estimators. Spatial disaggregation of data leads to imprecise estimates of mortality rates. However, appropriate weighting of spatial estimates of stock status leads to higher relative stock size than when data are aggregated spatially. Variation in performance measures is dominated by uncertainty associated with mis-specification of the rate of natural mortality and the steepness of the stock-recruitment relationship. Such uncertainties can be expected for an information-poor, spatially heterogeneous resource, therefore additional considerations besides the HCR should be taken to achieve a desired precautionary result in contrast to the situation for more data-rich scenarios. {\textcopyright} 2011 .},

abstract = {While previous research has documented marine fish and invertebrates shifting poleward in response to warming climates, less is known about the response of fisheries to these changes. By examining fisheries in the northeastern United States over the last four decades of warming temperatures, we show that northward shifts in species distributions were matched by corresponding northward shifts in fisheries. The proportion of warm-water species caught in most states also increased through time. Most importantly, however, fisheries shifted only 10-30 {\%} as much as their target species, and evidence suggested that economic and regulatory constraints played important roles in creating these lags. These lags may lead to overfishing and population declines if not accounted for in fisheries management and climate adaptation. In coupled natural-human systems such as fisheries, human actions play important roles in determining the sustainability of the system and, therefore, future conservation and climate mitigation planning will need to consider not only biophysical changes, but also human responses to these changes and the feedbacks that these responses have on ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Most ﬁsheries stock assessment methods are based on the assumption that ﬁsh are homogeneously distributed across the area being assessed or that ﬁsh movement is such that local ﬁshing pressure does not lead to heterogeneous spatial patterns of abundance. However, this assumption is seldom valid in practice. Seven alternative approaches for conducting assessments when confronted with possible spatial variation in ﬁshing mortality, growth and recruitment are identiﬁed. These approaches range from ignoring spatial structure, to conducting a multi-area assessment that accounts for spatial variation in biological and ﬁshery processes. These seven approaches are tested using simulations in which there is a single population with spatial heterogeneity, and the only linkage among areas is larval movement. The simulations are based on ﬁshery and biological characteristics for pink ling, Genypterus blacodes, off southeast Australia. Non-spatial assessment conﬁgurations that aggregate spatially-structured data provide more precise, but nevertheless biased estimates of initial and ﬁnal spawning biomass, as well as biased estimates of the ratio between initial and ﬁnal spawning biomass. Assessment conﬁgurations that allow for spatial structure can provide imprecise and highly biased estimates, although these can be improved by changing the relative weighting applied to different data types. A spatially-structured assessment conﬁguration that correctly matches the structure of the model used to generate the simulated data sets is unbiased but imprecise. When confronted with possible spatial heterogeneity in biological and ﬁshery parameters, we propose conducting sensitivity analyses based on several model conﬁgurations to select the appropriate structure for an assessment. The capacity to examine model residuals spatially remains valuable for inferring problems with model speciﬁcation.},

abstract = {Multi-species statistical catch at age models (MSCAA) can quantify interacting effects of climate and fisheries harvest on species populations, and evaluate management trade-offs for fisheries that target several species in a food web. We modified an existing MSCAA model to include temperature-specific growth and predation rates and applied the modified model to three fish species, walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus), Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) and arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias), from the eastern Bering Sea (USA). We fit the model to data from 1979 through 2012, with and without trophic interactions and temperature effects, and use projections to derive single- and multi-species biological reference points (BRP and MBRP, respectively) for fisheries management. The multi-species model achieved a higher over-all goodness of fit to the data (i.e. lower negative log-likelihood) for pollock and Pacific cod. Variability from water temperature typically resulted in 5–15{\%} changes in spawning, survey, and total biomasses, but did not strongly impact recruitment estimates or mortality. Despite this, inclusion of temperature in projections did have a strong effect on BRPs, including recommended yield, which were higher in single-species models for Pacific cod and arrowtooth flounder that included temperature compared to the same models without temperature effects. While the temperature-driven multi-species model resulted in higher yield MBPRs for arrowtooth flounder than the same model without temperature, we did not observe the same patterns in multi-species models for pollock and Pacific cod, where variability between harvest scenarios and predation greatly exceeded temperature-driven variability in yield MBRPs. Annual predation on juvenile pollock (primarily cannibalism) in the multi-species model was 2–5 times the annual harvest of adult fish in the system, thus predation represents a strong control on population dynamics that exceeds temperature-driven changes to growth and is attenuated through harvest-driven reductions in predator populations. Additionally, although we observed differences in spawning biomasses at the accepted biological catch (ABC) proxy between harvest scenarios and single- and multi-species models, discrepancies in spawning stock biomass estimates did not translate to large differences in yield. We found that multi-species models produced higher estimates of combined yield for aggregate maximum sustainable yield (MSY) targets than single species models, but were more conservative than single-species models when individual MSY targets were used, with the exception of scenarios where minimum biomass thresholds were imposed. Collectively our results suggest that climate and trophic drivers can interact to affect MBRPs, but for prey species with high predation rates, trophic- and management-driven changes may exceed direct effects of temperature on growth and predation. Additionally, MBRPs are not inherently more conservative than single-species BRPs. This framework provides a basis for the application of MSCAA models for tactical ecosystem-based fisheries management decisions under changing climate conditions.},

abstract = {Stock assessments provide scientific advice in support of fisheries decision making. Ideally, assessments involve fitting population dynamics models to fishery and monitoring data to provide estimates of time-trajectories of biomass and fishing mortality in absolute terms and relative to biological reference points such as BMSY and FMSY, along with measures of uncertainty. Some stock assessments are conducted using software developed for a specific stock or group of stocks. However, increasingly, stock assessments are being conducted using packages developed for application to several taxa and across multiple regions. We review the range of packages used to conduct assessments of fish and invertebrate stocks in the United States because these assessments tend to have common goals, and need to provide similar outputs for decision making. Sixteen packages are considered, five based on surplus production models, one based on a delay-difference model, and the remainder based on age-structured models. Most of the packages are freely available for use by analysts in the US and around the world, have been evaluated using simulations, and can form the basis for forecasts. The packages differ in their ease of use and the types of data inputs they can use. This paper highlights the benefits of stock assessment packages in terms of allowing analysts to explore many assessment configurations and facilitating the peer-review of assessments. It also highlights the disadvantages associated with the use of packages for conducting assessments. Packages with the most options and greatest flexibility are the most difficult to use, and see the greatest development of auxiliary tools to facilitate their use.},

abstract = {In principle, the spatial extent of fishery stock assessment should reflect the biological population, and major fishing patterns or population heterogeneity within the area should be represented. However, these theoretical requirements are commonly dismissed in practice, often when there is compelling evidence that spatial scope and structure is mis-specified and without testing if the mis-specified model performs well for informing fishery management. Population dynamics theory, case studies in fishery management as well as simulation tests demonstrate that accurately accounting for spatial structure in stock assessments can improve model performance, and ignoring spatial structure can lead to misperceptions of stock status and failures in fisheries management. Therefore, the development of stock assessment applications should include an evaluation of the most appropriate spatial scope and structure. Some common challenges in defining and modeling spatial structure can be addressed by adopting general best practices, but each species and its fisheries are unique. Accordingly, determining the most appropriate spatial structure involves 1) an interdisciplinary synthesis of all available information to determine the most plausible paradigms of population structure and fishing patterns, 2) the development of spatial operating models that are conditioned on these paradigms, and 3) testing the performance of estimation models and management strategies that are based on the current spatial management unit as well as alternative spatial scopes and structures that reflect population structure and fishing patterns.},

Indices are often calculated using area stratiﬁed sample means on age-disaggregated data, and ﬁnally treated in stock assessment models as independent observations. We evaluate a series of alternative methods for calculating indices of abundance from trawl survey data (delta-lognormal, delta-gamma, and Tweedie using Generalized Additive Models) as well as different error structures for these indices when used as input in an age-based stock assessment model (time-constant vs time-varying variance, and independent versus correlated age groups within years). The methods are applied to data on North Sea herring (Clupea harengus), sprat (Sprattus sprattus), and whiting (Merlangius merlangus), and the full stock assessments are carried out to evaluate the different indices produced. The stratiﬁed mean method is found much more imprecise than the alternatives based on GAMs, which are found to be similar. Having time-varying index variances is found to be of minor importance, whereas the independence assumption is not only violated but has signiﬁcant impact on the assessments.},

abstract = {Growth information is important for stock assessments because it gives an indication of spawning stock biomass in the form of weight or fecundity, which is an important indicator of stock status, as well as being important if fitting to length composition data. Sampling for growth characteristics should include all ages and sizes in the population, but data are often only available from fishery-dependent sampling, which can lead to biased estimates of true underlying population growth parameters because of selectivity, which includes both gear selectivity and availability. Two stock assessments with the potential for biased growth because of dome-shaped selectivity and lack of fishery-independent age data are the Gulf and Atlantic menhaden assessments. The objectives of our study were (1) to develop and test a method to estimate unbiased growth parameters regardless of the selectivity of the gear used to sample ages and lengths and (2) to apply the proposed method to fit unbiased population growth parameters for Gulf and Atlantic menhaden. We propose a method to adjust for the bias in the growth curve parameters and account for missing samples at smaller and larger lengths. The proposed method was tested on simulated data and applied to data for Gulf and Atlantic menhaden. Use of the adjustments was robust and resulted in reduced bias in the growth parameter estimates with accuracy being affected by both sample size and variability in mean length at age. Increasing the sample sizes increased the accuracy of the adjustments (i.e., as the coefficient of variation (CV) for length at age increased, the accuracy of the estimates decreased). For Gulf menhaden, the parameters estimated for the unadjusted growth curve were L∞=240.8, k=0.38, t0=-1.14, and CV of length at age=0.06 (assumed constant) with a total sample size of 366,710 from 1977 to 2011. For Atlantic menhaden, the parameters estimated for the unadjusted growth curve were L∞=350.9, k=0.32, t0=-0.83, and CV of length at age=0.12 (assumed constant) with a total sample size of 480,668 from 1955 to 2011. The adjustment for a maximum length of capture had a large impact on the overall growth parameters for both species, while the adjustment for a minimum length of capture had less impact. Bias in the growth curve parameter estimates can be reduced by using the method outlined to account for selectivity. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

abstract = {Abstract We investigated conflicting perspectives over a transboundary species (Atlantic Halibut-Hippoglossus hippoglossus L.) assumed to be one population spanning the border separating the USA and Canada. In Canada, the fishery is certified as sustainable by the international Marine Stewardship Council (2013). In the USA, that same population is listed as a “Species of Concern” under the US Endangered Species Act (1973). There are fishery-independent trawl surveys conducted by both USA and Canada on juvenile halibut abundance across the border. The data are sorted and both nations use their own jurisdictional boundaries to define the geographical area of their separate stock assessments. Here, we undertake a spatially unified, in-depth comparison of juvenile halibut distribution and abundance, and quantify the amount of suitable habitat for halibut across both sides of the border from 1965 to 2014. Juvenile halibut abundance was, on average, five times greater in Canada than in USA waters. The median per cent of occupied sets in Canada was about four times greater than in the US (2.5{\%}). These differences could not be explained by the availability of “suitable” habitat. The lack of halibut in US waters, in contrast to Canada, suggests a finer-scale stock structure exists and that halibut have not re-established in the USA due to historical serial overfishing. A gradient from high occupancy of halibut in Canada to lower occupancy in the USA is evident, suggestive of connectivity between the two areas and supported by a lag correlation analysis of temporal abundance trends. The USA may now be a sink to Canada's source of halibut. While both countries have been correct in their individual assessments, a bilateral assessment of halibut would benefit both nations, and could include analyses of how fishing patterns in Canada will influence the magnitude and speed of halibut re-colonization in the USA.},

abstract = {Several approaches have been developed over the last decade to simultaneously estimate distribution or density for multiple species (e.g. "joint species distribution" or "multispecies occupancy" models). However, there has been little research comparing estimates of abundance trends or distribution shifts from these multispecies models with similar single-species estimates. We seek to determine whether a model including correlations among species (and particularly species that may affect habitat quality, termed "biogenic habitat") improves predictive performance or decreases standard errors for estimates of total biomass and distribution shift relative to similar single-species models. To accomplish this objective, we apply a vector-autoregressive spatio-temporal (VAST) model that simultaneously estimates spatio-temporal variation in density for multiple species, and present an application of this model using data for eight US Pacific Coast rockfishes (Sebastes spp.), thornyheads (Sebastolobus spp.), and structure-forming invertebrates (SFIs). We identified three fish groups having similar spatial distribution (northern Sebastes, coastwide Sebastes, and Sebastolobus species), and estimated differences among groups in their association with SFI. The multispecies model was more parsimonious and had better predictive performance than fitting a single-species model to each taxon individually, and estimated fine-scale variation in density even for species with relatively few encounters (which the single-species model was unable to do). However, the single-species models showed similar abundance trends and distribution shifts to those of the multispecies model, with slightly smaller standard errors. Therefore, we conclude that spatial variation in density (and annual variation in these patterns) is correlated among fishes and SFI, with congeneric fishes more correlated than species from different genera. However, explicitly modelling correlations among fishes and biogenic habitat does not seem to improve precision for estimates of abundance trends or distribution shifts for these fishes.},

abstract = {Fishery management plans for U.S. fisheries are required to specify status determination criteria (e.g. whether the stock is overfished and whether overfishing is occurring) and typically use harvest control rules to adjust target and limit fishing mortality and catch levels to prevent overfishing, achieve optimum yield and rebuild overfished stocks. The status determination criteria are based on the concept of the fishing mortality rate (FMSY) that maximizes long-term catch as the upper limit on the allowable rate of fishing and the associated BMSY, the spawning biomass which produces MSY, is the target for rebuilding of overfished stocks. In practice, proxies for the biological reference points FMSY and BMSY are often employed. Although several methods exist for estimating these quantities, it is unclear which performs best. Simulation is therefore used to evaluate alternative estimators for these quantities. These estimators differ in terms of whether a stock-recruitment relationship is estimated, and whether a prior based on Bayesian meta-analysis is used as a penalty on steepness, a critical parameter of the stock-recruitment relationship. The simulations consider three life histories: a long-lived unproductive rockfish, a moderately long-lived and productive flatfish, and a hake, which is also moderately long-lived and productive, but exhibits highly variable recruitment. Results indicate that estimator performance varies among reference points. However, estimators of B0, the average spawning biomass in the absence of exploitation, and stock depletion based on a fitted stock-recruitment relationship generally perform best. B0 is estimated either better (the rockfish and flatfish) or similarly (the hake) to stock depletion. Estimating BMSY from the fit of the stock-recruitment relationship performed best for the rockfish and flatfish life histories; average recruitment estimators proved to be best for the flatfish and hake life histories. Proxy methods of calculating BMSY generally performed relatively poor in comparison to the non-proxy measures. The performance of estimators of biological reference points was generally better for the rockfish and flatfish life histories, which were similar, than for the hake life history. Estimator performance was generally poorer in the presence of high recruitment variability. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Spatial considerations in stock assessment models can be used to account for differences in ﬁsh population dynamics and ﬂeet distributions, which, if otherwise unaccounted for, could result in model misspeciﬁcation leading to bias in model results. Calculating an overall ﬁshing mortality rate (F) across spatial components is not straightforward but is often required for harvest management. We examined effects of spatial assumptions on model results under different approaches for calculating F. We show that (i) F can differ by as much as 50{\%} depending on the spatial structure of the model; (ii) for multi-area models, F changes with size of area for all but one approach; and (iii) results are sensitive to model assumptions about catchability between areas and the spatial distribution of effort and abundance. Findings suggest caution be taken when interpreting results between models with different spatial structures. When comparing single- with multi-area models, we recommend adding F across areas when catchability is the same between areas and either effort or abundance is proportional to area. Otherwise no single approach can be expected to be superior in all cases. We suggest simulation be used to evaluate the best approach to meet particular management objectives.},
